## üßê How Does It Work?

SpellForge is an exciting turn-based wizard dueling game that combines strategy, collection, and blockchain technology. In this 2-player game, wizards face off using their unique collection of spell cards, represented as NFTs.
Key Features:

-   **Spell Battles:** Use a variety of spell types including Attack, Defense, Healing, and Illusion to outsmart and defeat your opponent.
-   **High-Stakes Gameplay:** The loser of each match forfeits a random spell from their collection, adding tension to every duel.
-   **Shard Rewards:** Winners earn Shards (ERC-20 tokens), with the amount varying based on match difficulty.
-   **Spell Forging:** Use Shards to create new, powerful spells. The more Shards used, the more potent the spell.
-   **Trading System:** Trade Shards with other players to boost your forging capabilities.
-   **Limited Collection:** Players can hold a maximum of 5 spells, encouraging strategic choices in spell selection and forging.
-   **New Player Onboarding:** Upon account creation, new wizards choose 2 out of 3 presented spells to start their journey.

SpellForge offers a unique blend of tactical gameplay, resource management, and the thrill of collecting and forging powerful spells. Every decision matters, from spell selection in battle to managing your Shard economy.
